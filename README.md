Core Attributes
The SilverAppBar widget comes with three primary configurable attributes that control its behavior and appearance:
1. expandedHeight

Type: double
Default: 200.0
Purpose: Defines the maximum height of the app bar when fully expanded
Usage: Controls how much vertical space the app bar occupies before collapsing
Example: expandedHeight: 250.0 creates a taller expanded state

2. pinned

Type: bool
Default: true
Purpose: Determines whether the app bar remains visible when collapsed
Usage: When set to true, keeps a condensed version of the app bar at the top during scroll
Example: pinned: false allows the app bar to completely disappear when scrolling

3. flexibleSpace

Type: Widget
Default: FlexibleSpaceBar
Purpose: Defines the content area that animates and transforms during scroll
Usage: Houses the main visual content like images, gradients, or custom widgets
Example: Can contain background images, titles, or complex layouts that respond to scroll

Use Cases
1. E-commerce Applications
Perfect for product detail pages where you want to showcase large product images that elegantly collapse as users scroll through descriptions and reviews. The expanded state can display hero images while the collapsed state maintains branding and navigation.
2. Social Media Profiles
Ideal for user profile screens where cover photos or profile information needs prominent display initially but shouldn't consume screen real estate when users browse through posts or content feeds.
3. News & Media Apps
Excellent for article headers where featured images or video content can be displayed prominently, then gracefully minimize as readers focus on the article content below.
4. Travel & Tourism
Great for destination pages where stunning location imagery captures attention in the expanded state, while practical information like weather, reviews, or booking options become the focus as users scroll.
5. Portfolio & Showcase Apps
Suitable for creative portfolios where project previews or artist information can be featured prominently, then collapse to allow focus on detailed work samples or project descriptions.
6. Restaurant & Food Apps
Perfect for menu or restaurant detail pages where appetizing hero images draw attention initially, then collapse to prioritize menu items, prices, and ordering functionality.
Customization Options
Color Schemes

Primary and accent color configuration
Gradient support for dynamic backgrounds
Theme-aware color adaptation

Content Layout

Flexible positioning of title elements
Custom widget integration within flexible space
Responsive design for different screen sizes

Animation Timing

Configurable animation duration
Custom easing curves
Scroll sensitivity adjustments

Technical Implementation
The widget leverages Flutter's CustomScrollView and SliverAppBar components to create fluid animations. It utilizes the framework's built-in scroll physics and animation controllers to ensure smooth performance across different devices and screen densities.
The implementation handles edge cases like over-scroll behavior, rapid scroll direction changes, and maintains consistency with platform-specific design guidelines while allowing for extensive customization.
Screenshots Required
To fully demonstrate the SilverAppBar functionality, include these screenshot types:

Expanded State Screenshot: Shows the app bar at full height with all content visible
Transition State Screenshot: Captures the app bar mid-collapse to demonstrate the animation
Collapsed State Screenshot: Displays the minimal app bar state during scroll
Different Screen Sizes: Screenshots on phone, tablet, and web to show responsiveness
Interaction Demonstration: Series showing scroll gesture effects
Customization Examples: Various color schemes and content configurations
